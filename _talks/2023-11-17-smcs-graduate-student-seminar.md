This is a talk I gave at the UPEI School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences Graduate Student Seminar. In the talk, I showcased work from this manuscript:

Sarria Hurtado, S., **Sheridan, P.** Mullen, T., Lai, U., Onodera, T., Randhawa, G. S., Farooque, A. A. (2024). "A Statistical Significance Testing Approach for Measuring Term Burstiness with Applications to Domain-specific Terminology Extraction".
